# Audio Fix Guide for Three.js Ball

After analyzing your code in depth, I've found that the "metronome-style" throttling of sounds is caused by multiple layers of throttling in the code. I've created several fixes of increasing aggressiveness to solve the issue:

## The Root Problem

The fundamental issue is in the `events.js` file, where sound triggering is explicitly throttled in these ways:

1. **Time-based throttling**: Sounds are limited to play at most every 150ms per facet
2. **Facet-change requirements**: Sounds sometimes only play when crossing between facets
3. **Scheduler throttling**: A secondary layer of throttling in the sound scheduler

## The Solutions (From Least to Most Aggressive)

### 1. Quick-Fix (Already Applied)

The `quick-fix.js` script is already in your project and referenced in `index.html`. It patches some of the throttling but may not be aggressive enough.

**Files:**
- `quick-fix.js`
- `index.html` (modified to include the script)

### 2. Continuous Sound System (New Approach)

The `continuous-sound.js` script implements a completely different audio approach that maintains persistent oscillators with parameter modulation rather than creating/stopping individual sounds.

**Files:**
- `continuous-sound.js`
- `continuous-audio.html`

### 3. No-Throttle Events (Most Aggressive)

The `no-throttle-events.js` script directly attacks the source of the problem by completely disabling all throttling mechanisms in the event handling and audio system.

**Files:**
- `no-throttle-events.js`
- `no-limits.html`

## How to Use Each Solution

### Quick-Fix (Already Applied)

Just open your regular `index.html` - the fix is already applied. You should see audio controls that let you switch between standard and continuous mode.

### Continuous Sound System

1. Open `continuous-audio.html`
2. Click the "Enable Continuous Sound" button that appears at the bottom left
3. Move your mouse over the ball to hear continuous sound

### No-Throttle Events (Recommended)

1. Open `no-limits.html`
2. The fix is applied automatically
3. For best results, move your mouse *slowly* over the ball - this will give you the most continuous sound experience

## Technical Differences

### Quick-Fix
- Attempts to patch the existing system
- Increases limits and disables some throttling
- Works within the existing audio architecture

### Continuous Sound System
- Creates a completely new audio engine
- Uses persistent oscillators with parameter modulation
- Creates more musical harmonies between facets

### No-Throttle Events
- Most aggressive and direct approach
- Completely disables all throttling in the core code
- Patches the event system at its source

## Recommendation

For the most continuous sound experience without any metronome effect, use **No-Throttle Events** approach with `no-limits.html`.

Move your mouse very slowly over the ball to get the most continuous, flowing sound experience without any breaks or throttling.
