# Quick Fix Instructions

I've created several solutions to get your Three.js app working again with enhanced audio features:

## Option 1: Simple Self-Contained Version (Recommended for Immediate Test)

1. Open `simple-ball.html` in your browser
2. This file contains everything in a single HTML file - no external dependencies except Three.js
3. It has a simplified version of the interactive ball without the advanced audio features

## Option 2: Full Featured Version with Enhanced Audio

### Step 1: Combine the Javascript Files
The main JavaScript file was too large to write in a single operation, so I created multiple parts that need to be combined:

1. Run `combine-script.bat` by double-clicking it
2. This will create `quick-fix-combined.js` with all parts combined
3. Open `quick-fix.html` in your browser

This version includes:
- Facet-based sonic textures (different sounds for each triangle)
- Enhanced audio synthesis with a warm musical sound
- All the visual effects from your original application

## Option 3: Modular Structure (Original Goal)

If you want to use the modular structure (multiple files in the /js directory):

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. This uses the modular code organization in the /js directory
3. I fixed the circular dependencies that were causing issues

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Make sure you're using a modern browser with WebGL and Web Audio API support
3. If using a local file, some browsers may block audio until user interaction
4. Try running the files through a local web server for best results

## Backup Options

If all else fails, you can always revert to your original files in GitHub. I've maintained compatibility with your original design while enhancing the audio experience.

Enjoy your interactive 3D ball with its new facet-based sonic textures!
