# Three.js Ball Project - Bug Fix Documentation

## The Path Issue

### Problem
The project was experiencing issues with loading the menu functionality. The menu script was not being properly loaded due to an incorrect path in the HTML file.

### Root Cause
In the `index.html` file, the script tag for the menu.js file was using an absolute path instead of a relative path:

```html
<script src="/js/menu/menu.js"></script>
```

The leading slash (`/`) in the path makes it an absolute path from the domain root. When running locally without a proper web server, this can cause the browser to look for the file at the filesystem root instead of relative to the current HTML file.

### Solution
The fix was simple but crucial - removing the leading slash to make it a relative path:

```html
<script src="js/menu/menu.js"></script>
```

This change ensures that the browser looks for the menu.js file relative to the location of the index.html file.

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Proper Attribution
Added attribution and copyright information to the project:
- Added a copyright header comment to the HTML file
- Implemented a footer with attribution that appears on hover at the bottom of the page

### 2. Menu System
Implemented a robust menu.js file with:
- Toggle functionality for opening/closing the menu
- Collapsible sections for better organization
- Event listeners for various user interactions
- A status message system for displaying feedback to users

### 3. Main Application Structure
Structured the main.js file with:
- Clean modular code with proper imports
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- A global app state for managing application data
- Animation loop with performance considerations
- External API for controlling the application

### 4. User Experience Enhancements
- Added hover-activated footer for attribution without cluttering the interface
- Implemented status messages for user feedback
- Created fallback mechanisms to ensure the application runs even if some components fail to load

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Open the index.html file directly in a browser or through a local server
2. Check that the menu opens when clicking the hamburger icon
3. Verify that sound effects work when clicking the test audio button
4. Confirm that all interactive elements respond as expected

## Future Considerations
- Use a proper build system like Webpack or Vite for better asset management
- Implement proper path resolution through import maps or bundling
- Consider using a local development server to avoid path-related issues
